Description: tarsnapper is a wrapper around tarsnap backup tool
 Tarsnapper is a wrapper around tarsnap which does two things: (1) Lets you
 define "backup jobs" (tarsnap invocations) in a config file, though on it's own
 this has little advantage over just using a a shell script; (2) The ability to
 expire old backups using a Grandfather-father-son backup scheme.
